# Numerical-Methods-in-MATLAB
Basic Numerical Method Algorithms I learnt in a course that I thoroughly enjoyed and wanted to share.
Most of these go into the algorithm itself, rather than call inbuilt functions in MATLAB. They may not be fully optimized, they may not combine methods, they are very crude, but they're the foundation.
These are all performed in MATLAB. Many of these can indeed be done by hand (which I have done for another course) but even a few iterations can become tedious. So we turn to computers to do this for us. 1000 iterations. Million iterations. Tolerance of 10^-9. Of 10^-19. Whatever you want. 

I am yet to rename and sort the files and make them generalised. We used these for specific chemical engineering applications, so they may not be fully generalised yet.
Also some of these scripts may even call functions that are not present in this repository. That remains to be sorted.
