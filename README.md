# Numerical-Methods-in-MATLAB
Basic Numerical Method Algorithms I learnt in a course and wanted to share.
I am yet to rename and sort the files and make them generalised. We used these for specific chemical engineering applications, so they may not be fully generalised yet.
Also some of these scripts may even call functions that are not present in this repository. That remains to be sorted.
