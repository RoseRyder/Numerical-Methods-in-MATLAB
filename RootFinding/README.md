Root finding is one of the core concepts in Numerical Methods. 
We know the analytical solutions to linear equations, quadratic equations...
But what do we do when we don't have a formula for the solution?
Engineering can't stop just because the analytical solution isn't there.
So we guess. And get closer. And get closer (the technical term is 'converge') 
And hit up on the root we want.
